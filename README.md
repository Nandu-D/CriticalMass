Work / Project Examples

1. Hardline Hackathon\
I was part of a team of three. The objective was to complete as much as possible of two tasks. First task being to train an image classification model for detecting the hammer of a mechanical hammer robot. Second task was to train a simulated truck to reach from one point to the other using unsupervised learning. We used tensorflow for the first task. I learned a lot in the process. Learned more about tensorflow from a technical perspective, learned of other options of AI technology like PyTorch and cloud solutions. We could not finish it in time but we were very satisfied with the things we learned and with the whole experience.

2. Moisture detection using humidity sensor and arduino\
I did it for showcasing it in our college booth for "International Plowing Match". It involved connecting the sensors with arduino and coding the logic.

3. Word search game in android\
It is a personal project which I am still working on. Part of the UI is done. The logic for selecting words and arranging them is done. The logic for finding if a word has been found is going on.


Inspiration

1. What's New in ConstraintLayout (Google I/O'19)\
This was very informative for me. I used to mainly use linear layout or relative layout and after watching it I was very curious and enthusiastic about constraint layout. Now I use constraint layout whenever I can because I like it and because I want to learn it.

2. Derek Banas - Design Patterns Video Tutorial in YouTube\
It inspired me to learn more about design patterns. I grasped the idea behind some of them. After watching his tutorials I feel more confident in knowing why to use design patterns, when to use it and about its advantages.

3. Poka-techblog\
I really like the way they talk about javascript. I have referred their blog titled "Simplify your JavaScript â€“ Use .map(), .reduce(), and .filter()" for the code challenge. These are the kind of blogs that get into the whys and hows of using something. Such blogs are very helpful in understanding things.

Focus

If given the time and resources to study I would study react. You use it for front end and I wanted to learn it as it can be used for web and also for cross platform mobile development using react native. I also want to be of help to you.
For learning it I will configure it. Then I will go through the tutorials in reactjs.org site. I will pick up the basics from that. Then I will build websites to put together what I learned and learn more.
I may also go through "Derek banas" videos on reactjs.
