1. Hardline Hackathon
I was part of a team of three. The objective was to complete as much as possible of two tasks. First task being to train an image classification model for detecting the hammer of a mechanical hammer robot. Second task was to train a simulated truck to reach from one point to the other using unsupervised learning.
